// Shared PrismLight setup: registers a curated grammar set instead of the full
// Prism build, which bundles all ~600 refractor grammars plus the entire CJS
// theme barrel. The fence/file languages that dominate real sessions are
// registered here; unknown fence languages fall back to plain text without
// console noise (the highlighter catches the unknown-language error itself).
//
// IMPORTANT: every grammar is registered EAGERLY via static imports. The old
// design lazy-loaded rarer grammars with `() => import(...)`; Turbopack split
// those ESM-only refractor chains into async chunks and intermittently failed
// with:
//
//   Module .../languages/prism/c.js [app-client] (ecmascript) was instantiated
//   because it was required from module .../lib/syntax-highlight.ts <locals>,
//   but the module factory is not available.
//
// The async grammar chunk either raced with HMR or referenced a module factory
// in a chunk that was never evaluated, taking down the whole page. Static
// imports keep every grammar in the main client chunk, so no split/race
// exists. Grammars are small regex-based objects, so the eager cost is a few
// KB on top of what the core set already shipped.
